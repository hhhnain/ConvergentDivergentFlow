# ConvergentDivergentFlow
Python script that uses the isentropic flow equations to compute the flow through a convergent-divergent nozzle:
This script is reversable, although it gives the outlet conditions, you can reverse engineer this to get the inlet conditions. 
This is only valid for isentropic flow. 

Isentropic flow is a type of fluid flow that occurs in a system without exchange of heat or work. In other words, the entropy of the fluid remains constant during isentropic flow.

The isentropic flow equations are a set of equations that describe the relationships between various properties of a fluid, such as pressure, temperature, density, velocity, and Mach number, during isentropic flow. These equations can be used to predict the behavior of a fluid as it flows through a system, such as a nozzle, a compressor, or a turbine.

Some of the key relationships in the isentropic flow equations are:

The isentropic flow equations relate the inlet and outlet conditions of a fluid flow, such as the inlet pressure, temperature, and velocity, to the outlet pressure, temperature, and velocity.
The isentropic flow equations describe the relationship between the Mach number and the area ratio of a nozzle or diffuser. For example, the Mach number at the outlet of a nozzle can be calculated given the area ratio and the Mach number at the inlet.
The isentropic flow equations can be used to calculate the work and power output of a system, such as a turbine or a compressor.
The isentropic flow equations can be used to calculate the thrust and efficiency of a rocket or jet engine.
Overall, the isentropic flow equations are a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of fluids as they flow through a system.
